# HARDHAT PROJECT TEMPLATE

Since it takes a while to scarfold a new hardhat project—as we all know—I've given you this code; all you have to do is follow the instructions.

Clone the repo and install the neccessary packages

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/WebSculptor/hardhat-template
    npm install
```

In your vscode, open the repository, make a `.env` file, and insert this code into it.

```shell
YOUR_ALCHEMY_MAINNET_API_URL="<your-alchemy-mainnet-api-url>"
YOUR_ALCHEMY_SEPOLIA_API_URL="<your-alchemy-sepolia-api-url>"
YOUR_METAMASK_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="<your-metamask-account-private-key>"
YOUR_ALCHEMY_MUMBAI_API_URL="<your-alchemy-mumbai-api-url>"
```
